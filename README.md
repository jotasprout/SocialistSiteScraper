# Socialist Site Scraper
## September 25, 2017
Aggregator for following socialist candidates during election season. Inspired by my 2012 election blog that followed all 14 candidates on the FL presidential ballot.

## New Notes (March 11, 2019)
While writing a blog about all the presidential candidates on the Florida ballot in 2012, I found it tedious and frustrating to keep up with all the events from all the so-called "third party" and write-in candidates.

This was one of the two muses I had, inspiring me to really learn programming at a deeper level. I needed to write something that could aggregate news and information from a variety of web sites. 

I asked in some "learn programming" type forums how to do such a thing and was told on more than one occasion that Python was the language I should learn. 

I was soon distracted by others that I needed to know so I could build and manage a database, etc. so two years later, after going in depth with PHP, MySQL, and Javascript, here I am back to Python. 

To keep this project reasonable in size, I stuck with only the socialist candidates (also in keeping with the original inspiration).
